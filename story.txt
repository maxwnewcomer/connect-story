First Paragraph: Charlie walked alone in the park. It was dark, he was scared. 
Charlie had just submitted a CS400 project, but just as the due date closed he 
realized his most recent upload to Canvas was his project, but without the three days of
updates he had been working on tirelessly the entire week. He tried to convince
himself that everything was ok: "At least I submitted something", he muttered to 
himself. But he knew it was NOT ok.
