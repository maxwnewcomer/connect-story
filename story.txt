First Paragraph: Charlie walked alone in the park. It was dark, he was scared. 
Charlie had just submitted a CS400 project, but just as the due date closed he 
realized his most recent upload to Canvas was his project, but without the three days of
updates he had been working on tirelessly the entire week. He tried to convince
himself that everything was ok: "At least I submitted something", he muttered to 
himself. But he knew it was NOT ok.

Megan: As the semester was approaching the middle, Charlie realized that his 
grade was a bit further from him desired grade in the class. So, from that point
on, Charlie vowed that he will always earn those extra points from then on.

Ayaz: Charlie noticed on his canvas that the next CS400 project had just been released.
He knew what he had to do. He sat down, cleared his desk and got to work. Eight grueling
hours later he completely finished the project and submitted. He was happy as he kept his vow
and got the early submition points.
